Description: A package with focus on analysis of discrete regions of the genome. This package is useful for investigation of one or a few genes using Affymetrix data, since it will extract probe level data using the Affymetrix Power Tools application and wrap these data into a ProbeLevelSet. A ProbeLevelSet directly extends the expressionSet, but includes additional information about the sequence of each probe and the probe set it is derived from. The package includes a number of functions used for plotting these probe level data as a function of location along sequences of mRNA-strands. This can be used for analysis of variable splicing, and is especially well suited for use with exon-array data.
